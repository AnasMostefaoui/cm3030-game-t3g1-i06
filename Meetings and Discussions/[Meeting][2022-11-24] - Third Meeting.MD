## Points covered
- Discussed prototypes created for spider type and twins/multi player controlled
- Twins/Multi player control style game favourable
- Discussed 2D vs 3D - Decided 3D or 2.5D would be best due to availability of assets and ability to create 3D assets. Using 2.5D could lessen the details needed on the 3D models making it a viable option
- Having characters with different abilities e.g. one fast one slow is favourable. what are the abilities they would have in 3D space?
- Discussed how player could interact in the scene. Do they follow each other? 
- Discussed the need to start looking at assets to confirm availability
